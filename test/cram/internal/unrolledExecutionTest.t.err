Test execution of the mapping reports workflow on some very tiny
datasets.  This test is likely a bit "volatile" in the sense that it's
overly sensitive to addition of new plots, etc.  But let's keep it
until we have a better plan.

  $ BH_ROOT=$TESTDIR/../../../

Generate mapping reports workflow, starting from subreads.

  $ bauhaus2 --no-smrtlink --noGrid generate -w UnrolledNoHQMapping -t ${BH_ROOT}test/data/two-tiny-movies-unrolled.csv -o unrolled-mapping
  Validation and input resolution succeeded.
  Generated runnable workflow to "unrolled-mapping"

  $ (cd unrolled-mapping && ./run.sh >/dev/null 2>&1)


  $ tree -I __pycache__ unrolled-mapping
