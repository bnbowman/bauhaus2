      Map subreads to the reference and call consensus using arrow (or
      quiver, if selected) at different coverage cuts.  Masks regions
      known to be untrustworthy in the reference.  Generate plots and
      tables of these results.
  
      This workflow will only work for references that have been curated
      by the consensus team.
