Motivation
==========

For interop with Zia, bauhaus2 workflows that result in analysis plots
or tables need to advertise the plots/tables they have created in a
simple JSON manifest file. This is basically a stripped-down version of
the report file that was generated by

Report file spec
================

All plots and tables should land in a subdirectory of the
**\*reports\*** directory in the project.

Any output directory that contains output plots/CSV tables should
contain a file \`report.json\` summarizing the plots and tables.

The basic format for the report.json file is as follows:

\`\`\`json { "plots": \[ { "id": "pbi~sampled~.mismatch~bysnr~",
"image": "mismatch~ratebysnr~.png", "title": "Mismatch Error Rates by
SNR", "caption": "Alignment-based mismatch Rates by SNR, calculated
using Al's method whereby blah blah" "tags": \["Accuracy", "Mismatch",
"SNR", "Alignment"\] }, { "id": "pbi~sampled~.delete~bysnr~", "image":
"deletion~ratebysnr~.png", "title": "Deletion Error Rates by SNR",
"caption": "Aligment-based deletion Rates by SNR, and here are some more
details of how we calculated this..." "tags": \["Accuracy", "Deletion",
"SNR", "Alignment"\] } \],

"tables" : \[ { "id": "pbi~sampled~.medianipd~table~", "csv":
"medianipd~table~.csv", "title": "Median IPD/PW Values by Reference",
"caption": "A paragraph of descriptive text", "tags": \["Kinetics",
"IPD", "PulseWidth", "Alignment"\] } \] } \`\`\`
