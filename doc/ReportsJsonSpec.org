* Motivation

  For interop with Zia, bauhaus2 workflows that result in analysis plots
  or tables need to advertise the plots/tables they have created in a
  simple JSON manifest file.  This is basically a stripped-down version
  of the report file that was generated by


* Report file spec

  All plots and tables should land in a subdirectory of the **reports**
  directory in the project.

  Any output directory that contains output plots/CSV tables should
  contain a file `report.json` summarizing the plots and tables.

  The basic format for the report.json file is as follows:

  ```json
  {
      "plots": [
          {
              "id": "pbi_sampled.mismatch_by_snr",
              "image": "mismatch_rate_by_snr.png",
              "title": "Mismatch Error Rates by SNR",
              "caption": "Alignment-based mismatch Rates by SNR, calculated using Al's method whereby blah blah"
              "tags": ["Accuracy", "Mismatch", "SNR", "Alignment"]
          },
          {
              "id": "pbi_sampled.delete_by_snr",
              "image": "deletion_rate_by_snr.png",
              "title": "Deletion Error Rates by SNR",
              "caption": "Aligment-based deletion Rates by SNR, and here are some more details of how we calculated this..."
              "tags": ["Accuracy", "Deletion", "SNR", "Alignment"]
          } ],


      "tables" : [
          {
              "id": "pbi_sampled.medianipd_table",
              "csv": "medianipd_table.csv",
              "title": "Median IPD/PW Values by Reference",
              "caption": "A paragraph of descriptive text",
              "tags": ["Kinetics", "IPD", "PulseWidth", "Alignment"]
          } ]
  }
  ```
