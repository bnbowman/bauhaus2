* Workflows
- [ ] CCS mapping reports
- [ ] Coverage titration

* Infrastructure
- [ ] Move to use smrtportal-release reference repo
- [ ] Move reference masks under itg directory

* Testing
- [ ] Execution tests: mapping-reports
- [ ] Execution tests: ccs-mapping-reports

* pbservice integration
- [ ] Stub out map_subreads_pbservices

* Long-term initiatives
** Dockerize the module dependencies
   If we can get smrtanalysis etc. into a Docker image (with a new
   image available frequently), we could actually make these workflows
   *completely* self-contained and reproducible---no need to depend on
   modules.
