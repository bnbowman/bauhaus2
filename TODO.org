* Workflows
- [X] CCS mapping reports
- [X] Coverage titration
- [X] Unrolled mapping +/- HQ
- [ ] Adapter re-calling / generic "rerun PPA"

* Infrastructure
- [X] Move to use smrtportal-release reference repo
- [ ] Move reference masks under itg directory

* Testing
- [X] Execution tests: mapping-reports
- [ ] Execution tests: ccs-mapping-reports
- [ ] Execution tests: coverage titration

* pbservice integration
- [ ] Stub out map_subreads_pbservices

* Long-term initiatives
** Make the paradigm that user specifies the *reports* desired, workflows then determined
** Dockerize the module dependencies
   If we can get smrtanalysis etc. into a Docker image (with a new
   image available frequently), we could actually make these workflows
   *completely* self-contained and reproducible---no need to depend on
   modules.
