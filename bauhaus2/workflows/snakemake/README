Naming conventions
------------------

Snakemake files and should follow this naming convention:

  verb-noun[-modifier]

The noun should refer to the input data type; hence
"ccs-subreads.snake".

Rules should follow the same convention, but with underscores
replacing hyphens.

For scatter/gather applicable workflows, scatter/gather'ing should be
considered the *default*, so that we only use a modifier to name the
unchunked workflow, e.g.:

  map-subreads[-unchunked].snake
